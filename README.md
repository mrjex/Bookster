# Web Development

I attended this course in `August - October 2023` and coded in a group with 2 other students. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vuejs and MongoDB were the big technologies that we focused on learning. Fortunately, I had prior experience of JavaScript in one of my AlgoExpert problem solving ventures:

- [Youngest Common Ancestor](https://github.com/mrjex/AlgoExpert/tree/main/Executionary%20Code/Graphs/Youngest-Common-Ancestor).

- [Blackjack Probability](https://github.com/mrjex/AlgoExpert/tree/main/Executionary%20Code/Recursion/Blackjack%20Probability)

- [Powerset](https://github.com/mrjex/AlgoExpert/tree/main/Executionary%20Code/Recursion/Powerset)


In this course, we developed a website as a project and had a final written exam at the end of the course. The project was strictly divided in 3 separate milestones with respective requirements, which required an agile effort to establish a cooperative and productive environment to successfully complete the project. The 3 milestones were structured as follows:

- **1.** Backend *(Complete all backend or server API functionality)*
- **2.** Frontend *(Complete all frontend or client UI functionality)*
- **3.** Responsive Frontend + Presentation *(Complete screen-resizing responsiveness functionality and present project)*

## Documentation

Although our implemented features were comprehensive, refactored and integrated in a well-functioning client-system architecture with a database, we did not put much emphasis on the documentation. The main motive of this course was to harness programming, systems and frontend as a whole, as documentation was a larger focus in my [1st Bachelor Year](https://gitlab.com/jex-projects/mrjex/-/tree/main/projects/1.%20courses/year-1?ref_type=heads). Nevertheless, we recorded a video that showcase the system in action and all implemented features from the customer's perspective:
